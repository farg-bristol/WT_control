# WT Control

A Toolbox to help control different aspects of the 7x5ft WT at the University of Bristol.

Currently the following functionalities are implemented:
- Remote Overhead Balance Control
- Vertical Gust Vanes Control

## Remote Overhead Balance Control

Have a look at the [OHBControl](OHBControl) folder for the code and a detailed documentation.

## Vertical Gust Vanes Control

### Installation

Once you have cloned this repository run the `addsandbox.m` file to add the relevent paths to your MATLAB path.
This must be done each time you open MATLAB (considering adding it to your `startup.m` file to automate this process).

To remove the paths from your MTALB path run `rmsandbox.m`.


### Usage

Please see the demo script in the example folder for the code to control the gust vanes.
